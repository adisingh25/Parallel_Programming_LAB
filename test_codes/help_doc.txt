command to execute 

gcc -fopenmp -o <executable_name> <file_name>.c

time ./<executable_name>


eg:- gcc -fopenmp test test.c                            ....to compile
        time ./test                                                  ....to run the executable 

‘time’ will give us the total time taken to execute the entire code ........this can be used at all places where execution time is asked. 

To run the code serially, just remove the lines that contibutes to parallel execution of the code and compile and run the code using the same command. Then compare the time taken to execute the programs serially and parallely.
